Handy settings to know about for MacOS.

Have you been setting up a new machine (from scratch / without an MDM) and thought. Wow it would be great to have a bunch 
of settings on the computer just how I like them? Well I have had this thought and this is a script you can run to set 
up your macOS system setting just how you like it very quickly.

This is currently limited to some defaults settings. However, it may be extended to cover additional settings at some point.

Maybe a script and a config file so you can quickly set up a machine with some defaults which make sense to you personally. 

It could maybe even ask questions for now. You can fork a copy and edit this to make it just how you like :)
