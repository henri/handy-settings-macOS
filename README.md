# macOS-handy-settings
Handy macOS settings can be quickly setup on new / existing systems.

Have you been setting up a new machine (from scratch / without an MDM) and thought. Wow it would be great to have a bunch 
of settings on the computer just how I like them? I had this thought and made the defaults.bash script which you can run
to set up your macOS system settings just as you like.

This is currently limited to some defaults settings and enevery saver settings. It may be extended to cover additional settings in the future.
This could be a config file so you can quickly set up a machine with some defaults which make sense to you personally. 
It could even ask questions. For now you can fork a and edit your own copy so it is just how you like :)
